# IW4L

This is [whosstyler's custom fork](https://github.com/whosstyler/iw4L) of
[vladtrc/iw4L](https://github.com/vladtrc/iw4L). It preserves the upstream runtime
and history while developing a custom interface and gameplay presentation.

Current additions include a frosted-glass pause menu, matching gameplay HUD and
tactical map, weapon inspection, and viewmodel glTF export.

Press **Esc** for the pause menu, **F1** to toggle the tactical map, or **F2**
from pause for the player list. The HUD displays live scores, ammunition, and
equipment bindings. The tactical map shows your position, teammates, and objectives.
The original project's credits, Apache-2.0 license, and notices are retained below.
Game data is not included; a compatible installation is required.

IW4L is a Call of Duty runtime written from scratch in Rust, on
[bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) and [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs/). Point it at a copy
of MW2 you already own and it loads that install's data into its own engine.

The on-disk layouts came out of reverse engineering the original binaries and
reading public technical references.

This whole project is written by an LLM.

## Status

No releases yet: you build it from this tree. Nothing here is stable either —
the API, the config format, caches and the wire protocol all change between
commits, so everyone in a session needs to be on the same one. Expect bugs and
desyncs.

The network side is for arranged playtests among people who already agreed to
play; it has never been vetted for lobbies full of strangers. IW4L sends nothing
home, and diagnostic files sit on your disk until you attach them to a report.

## Architecture

| | |
|---|---|
| assets | MW2 zones read natively; MW3 and Black Ops land in the same `asset_iw4` IR. |
| shaders | Retail D3D9 SM3 tokens translated to WGSL, so no DirectX at runtime. |
| rendering | One sorted drawsurf list; only the tess emitters fork per surface type. |
| physics | Fixed 17 ms step on its own accumulator. Framerate changes nothing about how a body falls. |
| simulation | One `TickInput → sim::step → Snapshot` funnel for server, prediction and replay. |
| network | Custom p2p wire over UDP: deltas, reliability, reconciliation. A QUIC master only introduces peers. |
| platforms | Linux, macOS (Metal) and a portable Windows build. |

Retail protocols, the original ABI and patched executables are out of scope.
IW4L clients talk to IW4L clients.

## Game data

`IW4L_GAMES` points at the folder holding your game trees. No assets ship in
this repository or in any release, and IW4L is unaffiliated with the rights
holders of the original games.

Those trees are read only. IW4L never patches them, swaps files in them or
writes anything back; caches, settings, demos and logs land in
`iw4l-artifacts/` next to the IW4L binary.

## Build and run

System packages first: [`docs/BUILD.md`](docs/BUILD.md) (Fedora / Debian /
Arch — compiler, ALSA, udev, X11/Wayland headers; macOS — Xcode command line
tools).

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # IW4L_GAMES — folder containing the game trees
make map mp_boneyard          # run a map
make map mp_boneyard CMDS='spawn assault; wait 2s; quit'
make help                     # every recipe
```

Live runs use `[profile.play]`, a development build with optimizations turned
on. `PROFILE=release` builds the real release binary.
[`docs/WINDOWS.md`](docs/WINDOWS.md) covers Windows.

## Contributing and support

A personal, experimental project. Bug reports are welcome and get no promised
fix date. [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) says what a useful report
contains and how changes get reviewed; security reports go to
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
